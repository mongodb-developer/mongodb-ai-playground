# MongoDB AI Playground

MongoDB AI Playground is a set of interactive widgets for to explore, test, and visualize MongoDB-powered AI capabilities in notebooks, including Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and GraphRAG workflows, using modern LLM and vector search integrations.

## Overview

![Screenshot MongoDB AI Playground](assets/screenshot1.png)

Built as a set of [AnyWidget](https://anywidget.dev/) Jupyter widgets, this playground is designed for rapid prototyping, learning, and demonstration of GenAI + MongoDB workflows.

## Prerequisites

- An [**Atlas account**](https://account.mongodb.com/account/register?tck=docs_atlas) with a cluster running **MongoDB version 6.0.11**, **7.0.2**, or later (including release candidates). Ensure your **IP address** is included in your Atlas project's [**access list**](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/security/ip-access-list/#std-label-access-list). To learn more, see [**Create a Cluster**](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/tutorial/create-new-cluster/#std-label-create-new-cluster).
- An environment to run interactive Python notebooks such as JupyterLab, Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab and VSCode. Make sure you have widget support enabled (it is enabled by default on most platforms).
- Create a database and collection (if you choose to use an existing collection, usage with the playground will erase the collection's data. Providing a new collection is recommended)
- [**Create an Atlas Vector Search index**](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/indexes/create-vector-search-index/) with the correct dimension associated with the embedding model you will use. The field containing the embedding must be named **`embedding`**.

## Installation

```bash
pip install mongodb-ai-playground
```

## Usage

### RAG Playground

```python
from mongodb_ai_playground import MongoDBRAGPlayground

# Example: Pass your own loader, embedding model, LLM, and MongoDB collection
widget = MongoDBRAGPlayground(
    loader=...,              # LangChain loader
    embedding_model=...,     # LangChain embedding model 
    llm=...,                 # LangChain Chat Model (LLM) for answering questions (OpenAI, Claude, DeepSeek, etc.)
    mongo_collection=...,    # PyMongo collection for storing vectors
    index_name=...           # Name of your Atlas Vector Search index, you need to create if you don't have one, with the correct dimension (field containing the embedding is 'embedding')
)
widget # Display the playground widget
```

- All interactions are performed via the interactive UI in Jupyter-compatible environments.
- Visualize chunking, embeddings, vector search results, and question answering.

## Features

- üìÑ **Document Chunking**: Flexible strategies (fixed, recursive, markdown) for splitting documents.
- üß† **Embeddings & Vector Search**: Store and search embeddings in MongoDB Atlas using [langchain-mongodb](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain-mongodb).
- üîé **RAG Playground UI**: Step-by-step interface for chunking, embedding, and querying.
- üï∏Ô∏è **Knowledge Graph RAG**: Build and visualize entity/relation graphs from docs and run graph-based QA.
- üß© **Extensible**: Built for experimentation with LangChain so that you can use different loaders, embeddings models, LLMs and more.
